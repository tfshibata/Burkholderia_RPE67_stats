Burkholderia_RPE67_stats
========================
Burkholderia_RPE67_stats.job was used to calculate mean maximum subread length of the sequencing data of Burkholderia sp. strain RPE67 genome with PacBio RS/RSII.  The scripts, fastqmaxlengths.rb and flatmaxlengthstat.rb were used in Burkholderia_RPE67_stats.job. Another script used in Burkholderia_RPE67_stats.job, fastaLengths.pl was written by Jarrod Chapman and Isaac Ho (http://misccb.googlecode.com/git-history/f5184641cf89e8d9ad071d27f4f31dd85817ac42/fastaLengths.pl?r=f5184641cf89e8d9ad071d27f4f31dd85817ac42).
